# Custom-Yolov8-Deep-Learning-Based-Automated-Sorting-of-Open-Shell-and-Closed-Shell-Pistachios-
This notebook demonstrates how to train a Custom YOLOv8n model for object detection using a user-defined dataset. It covers the full pipeline from dataset preparation to model training and evaluation.

## 🛠️Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Colab Notebook

Make sure you have a compatible **GPU** (NVIDIA recommended) and CUDA installed.  

## 📘 Project Overview
This notebook is designed to train a **custom YOLOv8 model** on a user-defined dataset — for example, detecting or classifying **pistachio shells (open vs. closed)** in an industrial sorting system.  
The workflow can easily be adapted for any other object detection task.
